# dsa-practice

This repo has the solutions which I practiced for my DSA skill improvement.

I add those questions here which I feel are worth to revise or thier solution is "crazy" or "cool".

### Note

This is an automated repository created using [leetcode-runner-cli](https://github.com/dvishal485/leetcode-runner-cli).

I just do `leetcode-runner-cli -p` to save my solutions along with the question and the README.md gets updated as well.
